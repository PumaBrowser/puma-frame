# Submission for thirdweb hackathon

- Using thirdweb engine
- Contract hosted on thirdweb
- coinbase/onchainkit for frames

## Environment

You can use this project with your own environment by creating a `.env.local` from `.env.template`. Filling in all the details should get you going. The only thing to consider is the farcaster user ids and handles. Check the implementation inside `config.ts` to see how to use the `FARCASTER_USER_ID` and `FARCASTER_USER_HANDLE` environment variables.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
